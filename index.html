	As Emperor
	</h1>
	Over time Nero started his darker nature and started becoming more brutal and despotic as the days passed. He murdered many people and many of them were closely related to him. Among these people were his mother, his first wife <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/edison.k12.nj.us/file/d/0B7wz83TS-Mv2NGxoUmpmdjlGZDg/view?usp=sharing">(Ocatavia)</a>, and his second wife <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/edison.k12.nj.us/file/d/0B7wz83TS-Mv2VEktVmZKaHU2X28/view?usp=sharing">(Poppaea)</a>.<br>

		The Fall
	</h1>
	Nero satrted ignoring his advisers as his mideeds started to multiply. Nero's biggest notoriety came in the fire which took out 2/3 of the capital city in AD 64. Nero tried to help the city during this period by building shelters for the poor and rebuilding buildings. But many Romans believed that Nero himself caused the fire(FALSE). The suspicions of Romans grew when Nero changed a large area that was destroyed by the fire into his own personal pleasure park and palace. Most people thought this was a waste and this hightened their hate for Nero. Many Romans started plotting his assassination. Nero learned about the plans and and he responded by torturing, executing, or exiling hundreds of people. Among these these unfortunates was <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/edison.k12.nj.us/file/d/0B7wz83TS-Mv2QWhqQ0ZtclVuRGc/view?usp=sharing">Seneca</a>, his mentor and adviser.In 68 AD the soldiers started calling their commanders, emperors. Soon afterwards the Senate announced Nero enemy of the people. Nero fled to a villa close by and the disraced emperor took his life when he realized that soldiers were closing in.
